                        This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come
                        out
                        stronger
                        than
                        before. Its a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California poppy.

        The Poppy Bear
        This design is inspired by the quote ‘grow through what you go through’ and represents the strength of
        Californians
        and
        how we will continue to thrive, regardless of what knocks us down.
